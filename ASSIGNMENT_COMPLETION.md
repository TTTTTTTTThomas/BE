### 🚀 Key Features Implemented

#### ✅ Component Library

- **Button Component**: Multiple variants (primary, secondary, danger) and sizes (small, medium, large)
- **Card Component**: Flexible container with optional title and customizable styling
- **TypeScript Interfaces**: Comprehensive prop definitions with JSDoc documentation
- **Tailwind CSS**: Modern utility-first styling approach

#### ✅ Code Quality Stack

- **Prettier**: Code formatting with consistent style enforcement
- **ESLint**: Advanced linting with TypeScript, React, and accessibility rules
- **Vitest**: Modern testing framework with jsdom environment for component testing
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing with user-centric approach

#### ✅ Pre-commit Automation

- **Husky**: Git hooks integration
- **lint-staged**: Runs quality checks only on staged files
- **Automated Pipeline**: ESLint fix → Prettier format → Vitest tests

#### ✅ CI/CD Pipeline

- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing on multiple Node.js versions (18.x, 20.x)
- **Multi-stage Validation**: Prettier → ESLint → Tests → Build
- **Docker Integration**: Containerized production build
- **Code Coverage**: Test coverage reporting with Codecov integration

#### ✅ Container & Deployment

- **Multi-stage Docker Build**: Optimized production image with nginx
- **Port Configuration**: Serves on localhost:8018 as specified
- **Quality Gate Integration**: Builds only pass if all quality checks succeed
- **Production Ready**: Optimized for deployment with proper working directory naming

### 🧪 Testing Results

**All Tests Passing**: 9/9 tests successful

- Button Component: 5 tests (rendering, interactions, variants, sizes)
- Card Component: 4 tests (content rendering, variants, custom classes)

### 📋 Available Commands

```bash
npm run dev              # Development server on http://localhost:5174
npm run build            # Production build
npm run lint             # ESLint code quality check
npm run prettier         # Code formatting check
npm run prettier:fix     # Auto-fix formatting issues
npm test                 # Run tests with Vitest
npm run test:ui          # Interactive test UI
npm run test:coverage    # Test coverage report
npm run pre-commit       # Manual pre-commit check
```

### 🐳 Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build and run the containerized application
docker build -t guangxin_dai_coding_assignment13 .
docker run -p 8018:8018 guangxin_dai_coding_assignment13

# Access the application at http://localhost:8018
```

### 🔧 Quality Assurance

#### Pre-commit Hooks

Every commit automatically runs:

1. ESLint with auto-fix
2. Prettier formatting
3. Vitest test suite
4. Only allows commit if all checks pass

#### Continuous Integration

- **Multi-Node Testing**: Validates compatibility across Node.js 18.x and 20.x
- **Quality Gates**: All quality checks must pass before build
- **Docker Integration**: Containerized builds for consistent deployment

### 📈 Project Metrics

- **Component Coverage**: 100% of components have comprehensive tests
- **Code Quality**: Zero ESLint warnings or errors
